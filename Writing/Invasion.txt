====== Invasion ======
Created zondag 22 oktober 2017

By the time it was three in the morning my anxiety had reached peak levels. I walked outside onto the front lawn. My breath frosted in the light of the front porch but the night was not cold, only humid. The woods on my right were dark and silent. To my left the road snaked out past acres of fallow fields into the night. The horizon was beginning to brighten slightly - the onset of dawn. But it was too early: the sun was not due to rise for at least two hours.

It was almost inaudible but I heard it. The rumble of artillery fire in the distance. I had been waiting and dreading this moment all night. The first signs of the enemy breaking through.

They were still a good half day away, but it was time to go. I trotted back into the house and called:

"They're here! We have to go now!"

There was no reply. I repeated my call.

From the next room I heard the sounds of A and B copulating. I listened briefly, debating whether to interrupt them and deciding not to.

"I'm going" I told the room, unsure of whether they could hear me. "Don't wait too long, they'll be here by noon".

I waited for an answer, but none came. The sounds continued. I walked outside, past the veranda, to my car. It was parked out front next to theirs. I got into it, started the engine and backed out onto the lawn. For five minutes I sat in the car as the engine idled, watching the faintly glowing horizon. I looked back at the house. They were still in there. I put the car in the first gear and drove out the gate onto the little road, towards the woods.
