====== Sleep paralysis ======
Created zondag 22 oktober 2017

When I have sleep paralysis (and I recognise it immediately when I do), I sometimes hear a very, very, loud trombone like noise. Sometimes I am unable to breathe and unable to kick-start breathing, and lie there wondering if I'm in the throes of a hallucination caused by suffocating in my sheets. Sometimes I am unable to see, and unable to open my eyelids. In all cases I have no control over my muscles.

My senses channel information from the external world to my id. In sleep paralysis my id experiences a universe without external stimulation. If I could receive information from an external channel (Matrix-like), what would the nature of that experience necessarily be? Is there any reason it has to resemble the "real world" instead of the sleep paralysis world?

Once I had a high fever, in the bedroom above. I experienced the world so strangely I can scarecely relate my experience to the qualia of everyday life.
