====== Spaceport ======
Created zondag 22 oktober 2017

spaceport


The journey was long. After touchdown and a long, confusing, dizzy passage through the bowels of the spaceport, outside into the light, into the bus (ride the bus through the twilight back to the main city) or car (ride in daylight past clean industrial towers, factories, office parks, towards the main city).

Industry is clean. No grime, little pollution. Natural resources are relatively scarce (metals, hydrocarbons), population is on the low side. Efficiency is important: prevent waste, pollution.

flip side: the planet with so much natural resources that it becomes one giant dying cesspool.

Green planet:
- Massive wind farms, blades hundreds of meters high (hexagonal blades - hollow hexagon)
- Towns clustered together, clusters relatively far apart.
- Transportation primarily road or rail or water (lots of water transportation - canals, rivers)
- Relatively slow, no expectation to cross the world in 24 hours, provincial feel as result
- Lots of stone, brick, wood, where we would e.g expect concrete and steel
- Energy is not the biggest issue: fuel & raw materials are
- There are personal cars; not rare, but not owning one is more common. They tend to be built to last, parts are easily repairable, so few models, no fashion. Not very good compared to Industrial planet. E.g also steam-driven cars running on wood. Roads, outside of the urban clusters, tend to be one lane or even shared-lane
- ethanol (plant based alcohol) is biggest source of fuel

I come from the Industrial planet. For some strange reason it attracts many from the Green planet. I met her at the university & decided to spend the summer break on her planet, the Green planet. The faster pace of development, higher technology, the ability to satisfy ambition. I fell in love with her planet, wanted to stay. To transfer from the Industrial planet university to a local one, Tried to persuade her to do the same. Did i succeed? Did she come back to study locally with me? Did she go back, our paths diverge, she reaping the fruits of the higher pace there, I failing in my self-imposed task of proving that the Green planet universities were just as good

How do we travel between planets?
- They're in the same star system

********************
- I tried to explain the Industrial planet police to the old woman, but she did not grasp the concept of theft. I tried to explain.
"Suppose someone took something belonging to you without your permission"
"Like what?"
"Like, say, your ..." I looked around desperately for something of value, not finding much," your tree-reaper"
"Well, if they need it ..."
"But what if *you* need it?"
"Then I ask for it back"
"But if you don't know who took it?"
She thought about that one. "Then I look for who has my tree-reaper, and I ask for it back. Or they will bring it back, when they see that I need it."
Of course. There were few strangers in her world.
"But what if it's a stranger, like ... like me, and the stranger does not give it back?"
She struggled to swallow that. Her face screwed up, and she said "Well, if their need is great, they use it"
"But if they don't need it?"
"But why would they take it, if they don't need it?"

******************


A green planet day is 50 hours. The night is sleep - wake - eat - study\read\sew\talk\go out - sleep. They don't use hours. They use units closer to 6 hours. The unit size is variable i.e the day is divided into 7 or 8 units of non-equal size

********************************************

Series of novellas set in this planet

***********************

- Large tracts of the planet remain wholly unexplored - the vast majority, in fact
- Use earth terms for the green planet flora and fauna. Talk of oaks, willows, sparrows and squirrels. If the green planet life behaves differently, describe the difference directly ("The squirrel ate the cockroach between its paws", "the purple fronds of the willow in full bloom" )

- no real central government on both planets. On the green planet some governance in the larger clusters, but most things are a combination of tradition and unregulated enterprise
