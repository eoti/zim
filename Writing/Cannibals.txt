====== Cannibals ======

What would a world where humans are cannibals look like? I'm not particularly interested in ritualistic cannibalism, or cannibalism of enemies etc, but a world in which humans are consumed for their meat as we would consume cattle.
Probably a shortage of large mammals, no domesticated animals
Humans would be a main source of protein
No domesticated animals means slave labor
Possibly humans kept in similar conditions to cattle as well
Humans as cattle would be in the more "civilized" areas
Less civilized areas would essentially be opportunistic barbarism

What would people evolve to be, if it goes on long enough?
Slight preference for exo-cannibalism i.e. eating people outside one's clan
Homo anthropophagus children are particularly vulnerable, therefore would grow and become independent much faster than homo sapiens
I don't think large social structures will survive very well. I think the city state will be the largest unit, abstracting away the messy business of direct cannibalism into human husbandry
Mostly the family, the clan, the village as social units
Humans might evolve into smart, canny sociopaths
People in city states would be seen as more effete than the country folk

Other behaviors
Poisoning oneself to make the flesh inedible (leading to methods of treating poisoned flesh like we do cassava, or hakarl)
