====== Courtyard ======
Created zondag 22 oktober 2017

I walked out into the courtyard. The night was damp and chilly. I could see my breath condense in front of me. I walked across the stone tiles and leaned against a chest-high granite wall. I looked upwards. The sky was dark blue, covered in patchy swathes of translucent clouds. There might have been a full moon hidden behind the clouds but I could not see it. The stars caught my attention. They looked wrong. They were orange. Constellations of larger orange stars hung fixed in the sky. Between them, like tiny bubbles in a stream, clusters of smaller stars flowed, jewelled frog spawn caught in an invisible current.

"The stars look wrong" I said to X. "They're much too close. Some are moving too fast. These aren't stars"

X grunted, not particularly interested.

I watched as two swarms of thousands of tiny orange points eddied around fixed clusters of stars. They seemed almost autonomous. Like cosmic creatures, or piloted vessels. Like a swarm of fireflies.

I hurried on. X was already a dozen steps ahead.
